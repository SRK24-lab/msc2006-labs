- HTML subpages
    - index.html will be your homepage
    - subpages are additional HTML files that live within your website project's folder (these pages can be in a separate "pages" folder
    or can be within the same location as the index.html)
    the anchor element is used to define links to move between pages
    - <a href-"[insert link]"> [Thing to be linked] </a>

- Referencing
    - Case 1: index.html in MAIN folder, other page called about.html is in a folder called PAGES 
        <a href="pages/about.html">About Page</a>
    - Case 2: if you are moving from the about.html (inside the PAGES folder) and you want to link back to the index.html (move up one level)
        <a href="../index.html>Home</a>
    - Case 3: if both files are in the same folder:
        <a href="about.html">About Page</a>
    - Case 4: if you website has a pages that contains about.html, you can link to it like this:
        <a href="/pages/about.html">About Page</a>
        - Case 4 is different from Case 1 because of the "/" at the beginning of the href - this tells the browser to go back to the root folder
        (the website director)
        - Case 4 is the better format to use, than Case 1

- HTML/CSS Box Model
    - every element is treated like a box with ah width and a height
    - the box contains CONTENT, PADDING, BORDER, and MARGIN
    - Content: what the box contains
    - Padding: the space between the Content and the BORDER
    - Border: the Border
    - Margin: the space outside of the Border
    - css.land/box-model
    - you can go into the browser's dev tools to look at the elements of each box in the Inspector

- CSS_Recap
    - CSS has RULES that contain SELECTORS and DECLARATIONS
    - h1 {
        color: deeppink;
    }
    - h1 = selector
    - Declaration = color: deeppink;
    - Property = color
    - value = deeppink

- CSS_Selectors
    - tells our CSS which elements on the HTML page to style
    1) type selector: targets all of the defined elements
        e.g.) p {color: blue} -- this will make all p elements blue
    2) class selector: targets elements with a specific class, can be reused
        e.g.) .card {color: blue} -- will select any element that is assigned the .class selector
    3) id selector: targets 1 specific element, can only be used once
        e.g.) #header {color: blue} -- will select the one element that has the #header selector
    4) descendant selector: targets elements inside another element
        e.g.) div p {color: blue} -- only selects p that are in a div
        - Note: div is a container that you can put in other containers

- CSS Pseudo Classes and Pseudo elements
    let you style elements based on STATESS or specifc parts of an element
    - Pseudo-class styles
        e.g.) button: hover {background-color: blue;}
    -Pseudo-element - styles a specific part of an element
        e.g.) p:first-letter {color: blue}

- CSS & div tags
    - will let you style an entire section
    - div is easilty styled using the class or id attribute and associated selector
    - by default, browsers space a line break before and after the <div> element

- CSS Cascading Order
    - specificity: how targetted a CSS rule will be - the CSS rule wins based on targeting
    e.g.) a h1 rule will be more specific than a class selector
    - inheritance: CSS automaticall pass from a parent to the child, unless overridden
    e.g.) if <body> has a color, then a <p> element inside it will have the same color, unless overridden
    - order of Declaration: when selectors have the same specificity, the rule that appears later in the CSS file take precedence
    e.g.) if .box {background: blue;} is written before .box {background: green;}, the box will be green

- CSS display and positioning
    - Display:
        - block - takes full width, starts a new line
        - inline - stays in line with text, no width or height
        - inline-block - stays inline but allows sizing
        - none: removes the element from the page
    - Position:
        - static - default position in normal flow
        - relative - moves relative to itself
        - absolute - positioned relative to nearest parent
        - fixed - positioned relative to the viewport
        - sticky - switches between relative and fixed

- CSS Flexbox
    - arranges elements in rows or columns (one-directional layout)
    - used to structure smaller elements within a page

- CSS Grid
    - uses rows and columns at the same time (two-dimentional layout)
    - structures entire pages

- CSS: other things to know
    - background-color
    - text-align
    - align-items
    - font-size
    - font-weight
    - font-color

- Accessible design
    - this isn't something you slap on at the end - it should be part of the design process
    - things to tthink about - color, motion
    - accessibility determines who can use the website, so it should be part of the design process from the beginning

- Models of disability:
    - ways in which disability are understood:
        1) medical (deficit) model - disability is something that is wrong with someone. The goal is then to be how to fix them or compensate them
        2) Social model - people are not disabled by their bodies, but are disabled by society and design choices
            this places the responsibility on the designers to create intfrastructure, interfaces and systems that are accessible to all
