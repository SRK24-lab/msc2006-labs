Web Development III
- Javascript overview
- Brief discussion of image formats

- javascript: 
    - makes websites interactive, 
    - responds to user actions, 
    - changes content without reloading the page
    - adds animations and effects

- Javascript works using a Document Object Model (DOM)
    - whe your browser works, it turns your html into a DOM, which categorizes the different parts of the webpage
    - javascript can select parts of the DOM tree and changes it

- js file organization:
    - large websites use multiple js files - having all your scripts in one big file can get complicated
    - you can call on the different scripts when needed
    - better performance = only need to load the scripts that you need
    - better maintainability = don't need to look through thousands of lines of code to debug, instead need to search for each file

- adding js
    - inline: <button onclick="alert('Hello')">Click Me</button>
    - internal: inside <script> tags in your html
    - external: separate .js file, linked with <script src="script.js"></script>
        - this is placed at the end of the html's body (you want to let the html fully load first befor you act on it with js)
        - one way to test if you js file is connected is to use: console.log("hello");

- adding your first js code
    - console.log("hello world");
    - alert("hello world");

- js statements - tell the browser what to do
    - variables
    - operators
    - expressions
    - keywords
    - comments
    - conditions
    - functions
    - events

- note: you don't want to use js to dictate styling (ie: display = none), that is something that CSS is for. instead, use js to toggle the already existing CSS styles
