Slide 3
- preproduction in an animation uses a linear workflow, but interactive projects use non-linear workflows
- preproduction is important because the more time you spend planning out your project, the less time you have to spend fixing problems later on
- preproduction allows you to incorporate "design sign-offs" where stakeholders can approve designs before moving forward 

Slide 4 - Linear vs non-linear workflow
- content research - gives you a chance to learn about the content and understand how it all workflows
- storyline / script - think about overall story progression. At this stage, there isn't too much difference btwn linear and non-linear. 
- Prototype - these can be created in software or even on paper. 

Slide 6 - Storyboards
- a sequnce of diagrams that map out events over time
- can map out user interaction
- storyboards use arrows to communicate camera moves, objects moving. Because arrows have multiple conotations, you need to be clear about what the function of an arrow in your storyboard is
- storyboards don't really show transitions (how does something pop into the page - does it fly in from the side, dissolve in, etc.?). These are things that need to be addressed later in the process

Slide 41 - Preproduction for Games
- show button triggers / interaction that show user-driven events
- you can use 1 frame to show a variety of movements happening to illustrate the event

Slide 55 - Prototype
- can be figma-developed wireframes or can be pieces created in Unity
- when prototyping, use thumbnails to come up with different layouts and ideas of how to present information

- 5 dimensions of interaction design
1) Words - semantics or meaning
2) Visual Representation - Typography, icons that a user can interact with - create hierarchy
3) Physical Objects or Space - the medium that the user will interact with the project on. For example, mobile medium excludes hover animations
4) time - anything that changes with time (animation, sound)
5) Behaviour - consider how the users operate on your site based on their feelings as the use your Prototype
