            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>
                For our group project for the course, our group has decided to make a 3D video game in Unity. We are interested in making an interactive learning experience through the medium of video games, and we have been working on coming up with a workable idea to achieve this goal. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We have spent a few months brainstorming different ideas. This was surprising for me because I didn't realize how hard it would be to come up with an idea for a game. THe ideation process wasn't the hard part, to be honest. It was the fact that we needed to come up with an idea that would fulfill the requirment of being educational and fun at the same time. These two restrictions seemed to work at odds at times, and it made me realize that coming up with an educational video game can be hard.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've personally played a few educational video games in the past, some of which were very good, and some of which were very mediocre. The ones that didn't work, in my opinion, were very basic... in that the medium of a video game wasn't utilzed to its full extent. These games usually dump a huge amount of text at the player, expecting them to read it all, and then provide a quiz in the form of a mini-game or some challenge to see if they understand the material. I've always hated those sort of games because the idea of playing a video game was exciting at first, but instead I was tricked into reading textbook material.  
            </p>

            <p>
                That's why, for this game, I wanted to make the learning experience more interactive, rather than just making a glorified test simulator. I believe (and also according to the research we've done into educational games and game mechanics) that learning in educational video games should be a chance for the player to learn by making mistakes. This means that the player has to try something and see if it works, and if it doesn't, they try again until it does. In this way, they are more attuned to their actions and any new information that is learned is more than likely retained. Also, this adds a sense of challenge, creativity, and fun in the learning process, which is pivotal for something like a video game. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Keeping this foundational idea in the back of our minds, our group finally came up with the idea of creating a video game in which the player is a bolus that will travel through the digestive system. The goal of the bolus is to try and escape the GI system by moving through it, akin to an escape room puzzle, and the player will need to figure out how to complete certain tasks that occur during the digestion process in order to progress through. 
            </p>

            <p>
                After many, many ideas, this was the one that we settled on because we felt that it had a good balance of
                <ol>
                    <li>educational material that would make the topic complex enough to be used in an educational game</li>
                    <li>a creative way to tell a story while teaching about the topics of digestion</li>
                    <li>a good way to practice 3D game making and narrative writing</li>
                </ol>
                We decided to tailor our game to a high school and/or undergraduate student because we felt that we would get the chance to delve deeper into the complexities of the digestive system while also getting the chance to make a game with more nuance and narrative complexity than a simple game for kids.
            </p>

            <p>
                We started our research by examining various high school and undergraduate curriculums to see how they teach the topics of digestion to students. This allowed us to create a list of common learning objectives from which we could base the learning objectives of our game. We then individually began researching the various parts of the digestive system (based on these learning objectives) to get specific data and information that we could use to guide the game design as well as what topics should be presented to the player. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I was assigned to research the rectum and how the process of defecation occurs. After doing a lot of research, I finally decided on a style of gameplay in which the user would control the bolus within the rectum. The goal was to initiate the defecation reflex by growing big enough to cause rectal distension. The player could grow the bolus character bigger by rolling around and picking up fecal matter pickups randomly scattered around the rectum. The main obstacle would be the constant water absoprtion that would cause the bolus character to dry out. Drying out would make the bolus move slower and make picking up fecal matter pickups much harder, and if the bolus were to completely dry out, this would result in a fail condition of constipation or fecal impaction. To prevent this from occuring, there would be mucous pickups randomly scattered that the bolus could pickup that could delay drying. The goal of the bolus would be to last long enough while also increasing their size by the time they arrive at the internal anal sphincter, at which point there would be a check to see if the player was big enough to cause rectal distension that would initiate the defecation reflex. Here is a rough concept sketch that I made to support this gameplay idea:

            </p>

            <p>
                When we reconvened as a group and shared all of ideas together, we realized that there was a lot of disconnect in how people approached the ideas of gameplay and narrative. Some focussed more on using minigames to push educational learning, whereas gameplay like mine would be more integrated and concepts would be taught more than specific facts. The lack of cohesiveness made things a little complicated at first, but this was good because it allowed us to see different ideas and how different approaches could be used. 
            </p>

            <p>
                When we presented our initial pitch to the class, people seemed to like the idea of our game, but there were some valid criticisms:
                <ul>
                    <li>game scope was too large</li>
                    <li>how to visualize differents scales (i.e. macroscopic vs microscopic)</li>
                    <li>how to implement accessibility for all members of our target audience</li>
                    <li>lack of cohesiveness in ideas of how the game would be presented</li>
                </ul>
                These are all things that we as a group will need to keep in mind as we continue to develop our game further.
            </p>

            <p>
                One point that was brought up was the idea of having a "sentient" bolus character, and whether this misrepresented reality and would cause confusion. This was something that we as a group have been struggling with for awhile. It goes back to our initial difficulty with trying to make an educational game while also trying to make it appealing to the audience. We felt that our video game should be narrative based, partly because that's what we were more interested in making, but also because we felt that it would be a more appealing experience for the audience. Many of the other digestive system games that we looked at during our research and media audit tended to use the body's perspective, and we felt it would be more interesting to show the digestive process from the point of view of the bolus - this would make it narratively appealing but also, it would make our game different from the other ones that others have already made. So in that way, we feel that even though we are not fully representing the true reality of what happens to a bolus during digestion, we are taking the creative liberty to add metaphors and personifications in order to provide a more appealing experience for the player, which in turn would make learning more efficient. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As mentioned, I was already aware of the different ideas and lack of cohesiveness of the project as a whole. This was a worry of mine, but over time, I think it might have been a good thing because it presented us with different ideas and approaches to work off of. Also, the next step would involve a smaller script writing team to go through all of the information we had researched an come up with an idea for how to present the game. This is where I think the filtering will happen, and where the project will begin to become more cohesive as a whole. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Taking about scale in a game depends on how the player views the aspects of the game. Scale from a third-person view would be handled much differently than a first-person view. I think that when we start refining the specific aspects of the game and we decide as a group how we want the final game to be presented, then we will have a better idea of how to handle scale. For now though, I believe that we will use minigames strictly to represent microscopic environments while macroscopic events or games would occur in game from the bolus' point of view. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In terms of our game scope being too large, we definitely agree. We initially decided on storyboarding the entire game, but only developing one level. However, after receiving feedback, we think that our best option is to focus all of our time and energy onto one level only. We have decided on doing preproduction and development of the stomach level, as it contains many of the learning objectives that we would like to present in our game. In this way, our minimum viable product (MVP) would be the stomach level that a player could interact with, and this would allow us to gauge whether we could translate this experience to the other levels, or if we would need to make changes before beginning planning of the rest of the game.
