                <h3>CSS Layout Techniques</h3>
                <p>In this lab, I explored two powerful CSS layout systems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flexbox</strong> - Perfect for one-dimensional layouts like navigation bars</li>
                    <li><strong>CSS Grid</strong> - Ideal for to-dimentionala layouys like image galleries</li>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                This week's exercise was interesting. It gave me a chance to play with HTML & CSS, helping me get a
                better understanding of how multiple pages interact with
                each other. For the most part, it was easy to follow the instructions and build out the webpages.
                However, I found that a lot of the times, I was typing out
                code and not necessarily knowing what it does.
            </p>

            <p>
                One thing I realized is that there are so many tags and elements to know. It is very intimidating. I
                know that overtime, I can learn how different tags and elements work individually, but figuring out how
                they interact with each other to create a creative effect is another level. Creating a webpage seems
                daunting because I wouldn't know which tags or elements to pick out from the thousands that are
                available.

                I'm
                assuming this gets better with experience, but in the
                meantime, do I just keep Googling things?
            </p>

            <p>
                Also, debugging code was very challenging. Missing one / or - could break everything and trying to find
                the issue was very challenging. I have no idea where to start when I encounter a problem. <strong>I
                    wonder if there is some method to debug efficiently??</strong> Knowing which
                tag to choose to solve a particular problem seems impossible to me. I almost feel like I have to try out
                many different combinations of tags and elements and see which ones work... I feel like I need to get to
                the point where I can predict what tags will do when I use them, so that I can know how to use them when
                solving a problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                With regards to responsive design, I feel like I understand the concepts behind the code, but putting
                them into practice has proven difficult. Even on this webpage, you can see that there are issues with
                the responsive design. The right side of the <code>main</code> element is cut off when the screen gets
                smaller. The <code>footer-bottom</code> class should be positioned below the rest of the footer, but
                instead it is positioned to the right as a 4th column. I've tried figuring out how to fix these, but I'm
                stuck. Another issue (which may not be a responsive design issue) is that sometimes if I scroll to fast,
                the navigation bar gets stuck in the middle of the screen. Sometimes scrolling up and down again fixes
                the issue, but sometimes, it takes many tries.
            </p>

            <p>
                I think the problem is not that I don't understand how responsive design works, but more that <strong>I
                    don't understand how positioning works in CSS</strong>. Things like Flexbox or Grids never seem to
                work the way I
                want them to. In addition, how does this work in conjunction with absolute or relative positioning?
            </p>

            <p>
                Some other things I need clarification on are:
            <ul>
                <li>understanding the different units of measurement (i.e. rem, fr)</li>
                <li>
                    understanding how to position images with a box-container (if I want to focus on the left corner of
                    an image, is there a way to do this?)
                </li>
                <li>
                    How to align text vertically? E.g. how do I align the "Back to Home" text at the top of this webpage to the arrow img on its left?
                </li>
            </ul>
